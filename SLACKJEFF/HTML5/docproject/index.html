        GNU nano is a small and friendly text editor. Besides basic text editing, nano offers features
like undo/redo, syntax coloring, interactive search-and-replace, auto-indentation, line numbers, word
completion, file locking, backup files, and internationalization support.
        </p>
        <p>
The original goal for nano was to be a complete bug-for-bug emulation of Pico. But currently the goal
is to be as compatible as is reasonable while offering a superset of Pico’s functionality. See Pico
Compatibility for more details on how nano and Pico differ.
        </p>
        <p>
Starting with version 4.0, nano no longer hard-wraps an overlong line by default. It further uses
linewise scrolling by default, and by default includes the line below the title bar into the editing
area. If you want the old, Pico behavior back, you can use the following options: --breaklonglines,
--jumpyscrolling, and --emptyline (or -bje).
        </p>
        <p>
Please report bugs via https://savannah.gnu.org/bugs/?group=nano.
        </p>
        <p>
For background information see https://nano-editor.org/.

        <h2 id='opcoes_de_comando'>Opções de Comando</h2>
        <pre class="precode">
nano takes the following options from the command line:

-A
--smarthome
Make the Home key smarter. When Home is pressed anywhere but at the very beginning of non-whitespace
characters on a line, the cursor will jump to that beginning (either forwards or backwards). If the
cursor is already at that position, it will jump to the true beginning of the line.

-B
--backup
When saving a file, back up the previous version of it, using the current filename suffixed with a tilde (~).

-C directory
--backupdir=directory
Make and keep not just one backup file, but make and keep a uniquely numbered one every time a file
is saved — when backups are enabled. The uniquely numbered files are stored in the specified directory.

-D
--boldtext
For the interface, use bold instead of reverse video. This will be overridden by setting the options
titlecolor, statuscolor, keycolor, functioncolor, numbercolor, and/or selectedcolor in your nanorc
file. See set keycolor for details.

-E
--tabstospaces
Convert each typed tab to spaces — to the number of spaces that a tab at that position would take up.

-F
--multibuffer
Read a file into a new buffer by default.

-G
--locking
Enable vim-style file locking when editing files.

-H
--historylog
Save the last hundred search strings and replacement strings and executed commands, so they can be
easily reused in later sessions.

-I
--ignorercfiles
Don’t look at the system’s nanorc file nor at the user’s nanorc.

-J
--guidestripe
Draw a vertical stripe at the given column, to help judge the width of the text. (The color of the
stripe can be changed with set stripecolor in your nanorc file.)

-K
--rawsequences
Interpret escape sequences directly, instead of asking ncurses to translate them. (If you need this
option to get some keys to work properly, it means that the terminfo terminal description that is
used does not fully match the actual behavior of your terminal. This can happen when you ssh into a
BSD machine, for example.) Using this option disables nano’s mouse support.

-L
--nonewlines
Don’t automatically add a newline when a text does not end with one. (This can cause you to save
non-POSIX text files.)

-M
--trimblanks
Snip trailing whitespace from the wrapped line when automatic hard-wrapping occurs or when text is
justified.

-N
--noconvert
Disable automatic conversion of files from DOS/Mac format.

-O
--bookstyle
When justifying, treat any line that starts with whitespace as the beginning of a paragraph (unless
auto-indenting is on).

-P
--positionlog
For the 200 most recent files, log the last position of the cursor, and place it at that position
again upon reopening such a file.

-Q "regex"
--quotestr="regex"
Set the regular expression for matching the quoting part of a line. The default value is "^([ \t]*([!#%:;>|}]|//))+".
(Note that \t stands for a literal Tab character.) This makes it possible to rejustify blocks of quoted
text when composing email, and to rewrap blocks of line comments when writing source code.

-R
--restricted
Restricted mode: don’t read or write to any file not specified on the command line. This means: don’t
read or write history files; don’t allow suspending; don’t allow spell checking; don’t allow a file
to be appended to, prepended to, or saved under a different name if it already has one; and don’t
make backup files. Restricted mode can also be activated by invoking nano with any name beginning
with r (e.g. rnano).

-S
--softwrap
Display over multiple screen rows lines that exceed the screen’s width. (You can make this soft-wrapping
occur at whitespace instead of rudely at the screen’s edge, by using also --atblanks.) (The old short
option, -$, is deprecated.)

-T number
--tabsize=number
Set the displayed tab length to number columns. The value of number must be greater than 0. The
default value is 8.

-U
--quickblank
Make status-bar messages disappear after 1 keystroke instead of after 20. Note that option -c (--constantshow)
overrides this. When option --minibar or --zero is in effect, --quickblank makes a message disappear
after 0.8 seconds instead of after the default 1.5 seconds.

-V
--version
Show the current version number and exit.

-W
--wordbounds
Detect word boundaries differently by treating punctuation characters as parts of words.

-X "characters"
--wordchars="characters"
Specify which other characters (besides the normal alphanumeric ones) should be considered as parts of
words. When using this option, you probably want to omit -W (--wordbounds).

-Y name
--syntax=name
Specify the syntax to be used for highlighting. See Syntax Highlighting for more info.

-Z
--zap
Let an unmodified Backspace or Delete erase the marked region (instead of a single character, and
without affecting the cutbuffer).

-a
--atblanks
When doing soft line wrapping, wrap lines at whitespace instead of always at the edge of the screen.

-b
--breaklonglines
Automatically hard-wrap the current line when it becomes overlong. (This option is the opposite of -w
(--nowrap) — the last one given takes effect.)

-c
--constantshow
Constantly display the cursor position (line number, column number, and character number) on the
status bar. Note that this overrides option -U (--quickblank).

-d
--rebinddelete
Interpret the Delete and Backspace keys differently so that both work properly. You should only
use this option when on your system either Backspace acts like Delete or Delete acts like Backspace.

nano is a "modeless" editor. This means that all keystrokes, with the exception of Control and Meta sequences, enter text into the file being edited.
        </p>
        <p>
Characters not present on the keyboard can be entered in two ways:
        </p>
        <p>
For characters with a single-byte code, pressing the Esc key twice and then typing a three-digit decimal number (from 000 to 255) will make nano behave as if you typed the key with that value.
For any possible character, pressing M-V (Alt+V) and then typing a series of hexadecimal digits (at most six, or concluded with Enter or Space) will enter the corresponding Unicode character into the buffer.
For example, typing Esc Esc 2 3 4 will enter the character "ê" — useful when writing about a French party. Typing M-V 0 0 2 2 c 4 will enter the symbol "⋄", a little diamond.
        </p>
        <p>
Typing M-V followed by anything other than a hexadecimal digit will enter this keystroke verbatim into the buffer, allowing the user to insert literal control codes (except ^J) or escape sequences.
        </p>
